When a document is represented as a vector, each dimension corresponds to a separate term.	A document has representation as a vector.	3
To achieve this, the programmer has to note generalisations and similarities about various aspects of the program.	It is similar to divide and conquer, however is differentiated as its subproblems are not independent.	0
The further down an inheritance tree you get, the more specific the classes become.	The differing application has a direct influence on what the definition of the term means.	0
The algebraic model for representing text documents and objects as vectors of identifiers is called the vector space model.	The limitations of the vector space model are thus.	2
In general, dynamic programming is used on optimisation problems, where the most efficient solution is needed.	However, the key in Dynamic Programming is to determine the structure of optimal solutions.	5
It is used in information filtering, information retrieval, indexing and relevancy rankings.	A possible use for a vector space model is for retrieval and filtering of information.	2
The easiest way to look at inheritance is as an "...is a kind of" relationship.	It also provides a way to generalize du to the "is a" relationship between classes.	0
This means that inheritance is used when types have common factors and these would be put into the superclass.	It is "prior" in the sense that it does not take into account any information about B.	0
This means that inheritance is used when types have common factors and these would be put into the superclass.	The method can be abused when people deliberately link to sites in order to raise a site's PageRank.	0
